# HEDL Tutorials

Welcome to the HEDL tutorial collection! These step-by-step guides will help you learn HEDL from the ground up, with practical examples and hands-on exercises.

## What are Tutorials?

Tutorials are learning-oriented lessons that take you through a series of steps to complete a project. Unlike how-to guides, tutorials focus on teaching concepts and building understanding through practice.

## Tutorial Path

Follow these tutorials in order for the best learning experience:

Learn the basics by converting a simple JSON file to HEDL and back. You'll understand:
- Basic HEDL syntax and structure
- The conversion workflow
- How to validate your work
- Token efficiency benefits

**What you'll build:** Convert a product catalog from JSON to HEDL

---

### 2. [CLI Basics](02-cli-basics.md)
**Time: 15 minutes** | **Difficulty: Beginner**

Master the essential HEDL command-line tools. You'll learn:
- Core CLI commands and options
- How to validate, format, and lint files
- Reading from stdin and writing to stdout
- Common command patterns and shortcuts

**What you'll build:** A validation and formatting workflow

---

### 3. [Batch Processing](03-batch-processing.md)
**Time: 20 minutes** | **Difficulty: Intermediate**

Process multiple files efficiently with batch operations. You'll learn:
- Batch validation, formatting, and linting
- Parallel processing for speed
- Shell scripting with HEDL
- Error handling in batch workflows

**What you'll build:** A script to convert and validate multiple data files

---

### 4. [Streaming Large Files](04-streaming-large-files.md)
**Time: 25 minutes** | **Difficulty: Intermediate**

Work with large datasets that don't fit in memory. You'll learn:
- Streaming parser concepts
- Memory-efficient file processing
- Handling multi-gigabyte files
- Performance optimization techniques

**What you'll build:** Process a large CSV file without loading it entirely into memory
