# HEDL Tutorials

Step-by-step guides to help you get started with HEDL development.

## Overview

These tutorials are designed to take you from zero to productive HEDL contributor. Each tutorial builds on previous ones, but can also be followed independently.

## Tutorial Path

### Beginner Level

1. **[Setup Development Environment](01-setup-dev-environment.md)** (15 minutes)
   - Install Rust toolchain and dependencies
   - Clone and build the HEDL workspace
   - Configure your IDE for Rust development
   - Run your first tests

2. **[Adding Your First Feature](02-first-feature.md)** (30 minutes)
   - Understand the codebase structure
   - Add a simple utility function
   - Write comprehensive tests
   - Submit your first pull request

### Intermediate Level

3. **[Adding Format Support](03-adding-format-support.md)** (60 minutes)
   - Create a new format converter crate
   - Implement bidirectional conversion
   - Write integration tests
   - Add benchmarks

4. **[Writing Effective Tests](04-writing-tests.md)** (45 minutes)
   - Unit testing best practices
   - Property-based testing with proptest
   - Fuzz testing setup
   - Coverage analysis

## Learning Objectives

By completing these tutorials, you will:

- Set up a complete HEDL development environment
